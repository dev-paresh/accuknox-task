# Here what i have implement:

# I created a custom Django management command because I wanted to check whether Django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller.

# I used transaction.atomic() in the command because it ensures that all database operations inside it either commit together or roll back together if an error occurs.

# I connected a post_save signal to the User model because it allowed me to trigger additional database operations right after a user is created.

# Inside the signal handler, I tried to create another User with the same username because I wanted to force a database error and see if it would cause a rollback of the entire transaction.

# I printed the user count before and after creating the user because this would help determine whether the transaction was rolled back when the signal failed.

# When I ran the command, I saw that the user count remained the same (no new user was created), proving that Django signals run in the same transaction as the caller by default and will roll back if an error occurs inside the signal.

#sample output
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Test user deleted if it existed
# User count before: 11
# Signal handler triggered, attempting to create another user
# Exception in signal handler: UNIQUE constraint failed: auth_user.username
# Transaction failed with: UNIQUE constraint failed: auth_user.username
# User count after: 11
# Difference in counts: 0
# CONCLUSION: Signals DO run in the same transaction as the caller. The failed signal caused the entire transaction to roll back, preventing the original user from being created.
